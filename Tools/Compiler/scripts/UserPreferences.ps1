# User Preferences
# ------------------------------
# ==============================
# ==============================
# This class holds the User Preferences within this
#  program.  The user's preferences will give rise
#  to what the user wants to do with this program
#  and perform the task as the user's demands with
#  minimal configuration after the first initial
#  setup.  The goal of this program is to assure
#  that the user can merely 'click-and-forget',
#  thus the program should NOT stand in the way
#  of the user's tasks.  With that in mind, it
#  is paramount that the User Preferences should
#  provide little headache as necessary; in-fact,
#  all of the configurations within the classes
#  provides that same principle.
